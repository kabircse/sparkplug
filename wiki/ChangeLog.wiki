#summary Code Changes

= Version 0.31 =
 * Fixed a comment that was totally wrong
 * Added DeveloperInformation

= Version 0.3 =
 * Consolidated the files.  Check out Usage for the new implementation.
 * The dynamic version now has urls similar to what the generated version uses.  
 * It no longer uses posts for routing (phew).  It also looks almost identical to what is generated.
 * The primary keys no longer show in forms.
 * Segments are used as function parameters, so it no longer assumes segment 3.
 * All meta-data has been removed from the generated code (the model function still exists for convenience). 
 * And last but not least I added some comments to the code, so it should be a little easier to read.

===There were a few Versions in between that I don't remember - this page started with Version 0.3===

 * Library Created
