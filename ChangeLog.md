# Version 0.31 #
  * Fixed a comment that was totally wrong
  * Added DeveloperInformation

# Version 0.3 #
  * Consolidated the files.  Check out [Usage](Usage.md) for the new implementation.
  * The dynamic version now has urls similar to what the generated version uses.
  * It no longer uses posts for routing (phew).  It also looks almost identical to what is generated.
  * The primary keys no longer show in forms.
  * Segments are used as function parameters, so it no longer assumes segment 3.
  * All meta-data has been removed from the generated code (the model function still exists for convenience).
  * And last but not least I added some comments to the code, so it should be a little easier to read.

### There were a few Versions in between that I don't remember - this page started with Version 0.3 ###
